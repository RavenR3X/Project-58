        <h1>Gaming and Making YouTube videos</h1>
        <img src="download.jpg">
        <p>I like to play games on electronic devices because they are very fun even if I am not good at them they are still fun to play!. Whenever I am not doing anything beside playing games or making videos on YouTube I am probably just practicing Classical Music or reading a book or watching videos on YouTube. Besides practicing music, watching videos or reading a book, I do things that I find fun to do like, helping mom with her work so that she can get a rest from all the housework or just cleaning my table to stay organized and clean. Making YouTube videos is actually more fun than you might think they are you, just need to like those sort of things. After making some videos you get the hang of it and it's actually pretty fun making the video then editing the bad parts of it to seem good or just cut them from the video. That's basically what I do with the videos I create.</p>

        <h2> Playing Badminton and Football</h2>

            Another one of my hobbies is Playing Sports I relly like to play Badminton and Football. I am not good at either of those but I still love playing sports. But playing sports isn't an option now because Now LockDown has started but most people don't really care about going outside without wearing masks. I can actually play sports now but I don't know with whom because nobobdy plays any sports now-a-days. I like playing Badminton and Football because I grew up playing them and they are VERY FUN to play.I also go to coaching classes for Badminton(Well atleast I used to go).
